## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Project Structure
<pre>Todo-list/
│
├── index.html        ← Main HTML file  
├── css/
│   └── style.css     ← App styles  
├── js/
    └── script.js     ← App logic (task addition, deletion, storage)  </pre>

- Tasks are appended to the list in the DOM
- Each task item includes:
    1. A checkbox to toggle completion status
